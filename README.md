# Capstone-Project
All files and code relating to my springboard Capstone project

PROJECT IDEA 1:
  A music social media app that connects you with other musicians around your skill level for creating bands, finding session players etc. Users will create an account and profile that can include pictures and videos of themselves, demo music, genres they like, influences, and what they are looking for in other profiles. I'd like to integrate the instagram api so that their accounts can be linked. There will be a direct messaging system to reach out to people and 2 homepages; one thats global and shows posts from all the people you follow, and one thats local that only shows posts from people within your area that you may or may not follow.

PROJECT IDEA 2:
  An app where users can follow their favorite artists and will be notified when they are performing closeby, where to buy tickets, and when new album or merchandise will be released etc.s
